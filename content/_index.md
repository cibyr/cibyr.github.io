# Various Rants

This is a ... blog? I guess. Personal website. Somewhere to put longform (longer-than-a-toot) writing, that's not going to ask you to login or throw popovers in your face.

## Who am I?

My name's Ian. I go by `cibyr` online. You can mostly find me shitposting on [Mastodon](https://omg.wtf.sh/@cibyr), but sometimes I shitpost on [GitHub](https://github.com/cibyr) too.

## Greets

Shout out to my hacker friends, [thetarquin](https://omg.wtf.sh/@thetarquin) ([buy his t-shirt](http://makememories.io)), and [Ceelo](https://omg.wtf.sh/@InterferencePattern) (who will let you know [if quantum computers have broken crypto yet](http://areweshoryet.org/)).
